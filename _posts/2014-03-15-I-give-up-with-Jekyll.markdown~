In my last post, I discussed the upheaval my blog was undergoing - I wanted to change the genre, the technology, and pretty much everything else. During the time between then, and this post, I'd discovered a dream-come-true tool called [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Jekyll is a static-site generator built on Ruby, and it basically takes a bunch of blog posts (written in anything, including Markdown and Textile), and plugs them into pre-defined HTML templates. You end up with a blog of static pages, and you can easily FTP that to a web server. That's exactly what I wanted to do with my blog, so I tried it.

**And promptly thereafter, I went to hell**

I spent a total of 2 whole days trying to configure and install Jekyll, and I persevered, even with all the odds against me: I'm running on a Windows machine, and for those who don't know, Ruby doesn't play nice with Windows. I encountered numerous errors, many of which were related to the versions of Ruby/Python/Jekyll/whatever I used (yes, even though it's a Ruby app, Python is required). After hours and hours of misery, I was able to produce a bug-free setup, but was dismayed when I realized none of the actual software worked correctly. Basically, Jekyll wouldn't do it's job and plug the post into one of the templates I designed for it; instead, it gave the browser raw Markdown to work with, something that has no place on my blog.

The Jekyll IRC community was **useless**. No matter how many times I tried to get ahold of someone, nobody would listen; in fact, the one person who **did** give me time out of their day ended up going AWOL, once we started actually discussing the crux of the issue. Stack Overflow was the next place I turned to, with a similar result. Nobody had a solution for me, and with that, I promptly uninstalled Ruby, Python, and anything else I'd amassed from this ordeal.

But wait, doesn't the title say I've only given up with using Jekyll natively, on Windows? Yep, that's right.

As I write this post, I'm installing a Linux distro (Ubuntu, of course) to a Virtualbox VM. I'm hoping that Ubuntu's native Ruby support will be of more help as I try to transition to a Jekyll website.

> **Update:** As of March 17 2014, this website is up and running with Jekyll! I am officially love in Ubuntu Linux, and am crying with joy about how beautiful this system really is!
