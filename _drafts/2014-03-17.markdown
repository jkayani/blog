title: Markdown + Jekyll is amazing!

I'm really enjoying writing posts in Markdown. It's a perfect blend of simple, yet sophisticated. One of the best things about it is the formatting and content power it gives you, especially when it's used in blogging platforms to substitute writing HTML by hand. I'm not crazy either; many new blogging services offer the ability to write posts in Markdown, such as [Ghost](http://ghost.org), one of the most popular ones. 

Markdown is also why I enjoy Jekyll so much - its' been really refreshing to use compared to Wordpress, and honestly, it makes me want to blog more (although this is most likely attributed to the "renassiance" my blog has undergone). Back when I used WordPress, I wanted to be able to simply write in the text-editor, and have WordPress output beautiful HTML for me. Unfortunately, I wasn't *that* good with WordPress theming - often times, my posts would be full of errors, especially with code blocks and indentation, and it would be a nightmare to fix. It's ironic how my original purpose was to avoid writing HTML for blog posts, but I always ended up writing some to fix issues with my theme.

Those who are partial to Wordpress probably see a huge flaw in my logic; if I wrote a crappy theme to begin with, what did I expect? That's true, it was my first theme I wrote with Wordpress, and accordingly, it sucked. However, this is another area where Jekyll shines - it makes it **much** easier to create your own templates and themes for you blogs, using static HTML and [Liquid](http://shopify.com/liquid) tags. It's a beautiful approach in my opinion, and it takes the hassle out of maintaining a blog. 

In Wordpress, one uses the famous "Wordpress Loop" to generate a page full of posts, whether it be a simple listing, or the full content. The code looks like this:
{% highlight PHP %}

		<?php 
			if ( have_posts() ) {
				while ( have_posts() ) {
					// Do whatever you want here
					the_post(); 

				}
			}
		?>
{% endhighlight %}
I'm willing to admit that I went into working with Wordpress without a working knowledge of PHP (I had JavaScript though) - even with that, using the Wordpress loop could be downright annoying and frustrating, and it's almost embarassing to consider how much time I spent trying to work with it.

There are a few downsides to leaving Wordpress though, and one of the biggest things I miss are the plug-ins. Plug-ins were the go-to resource for utilties to enhance (or in some cases, fix - but that just means bad coding practices) one's website. Common web developer tools like Modernizr and Google Analytics could be easily implemented just by installing a few plug-ins your site, a feature that isn't quite available with static-site generators. I remember a particular SEO plug-in I used to use that would preview my posts before I publish them, and provide feedback on things like keyword density, title, reading ease, etc. Those kinds of things are extremely helpful when it comes to blogging, especially for first-timers like me. On an ironic note, all the SEO I did for my blog wasn't good enough - my Codepen profile sitll outranked my actual site on Google's search results.
